# AI Crash Finder

AI Crash Finder is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that leverages artificial intelligence to help developers quickly identify the root cause of production issues by analyzing Git commit differences. Using Azure OpenAI's advanced language models, this extension provides intelligent insights into code changes that may have introduced bugs or performance issues.

## Introduction

When production issues occur, identifying the root cause can be time-consuming and challenging, especially when dealing with large codebases and multiple recent changes. AI Crash Finder streamlines this process by:

- Analyzing Git diffs between specified commits
- Using AI to correlate code changes with reported issues
- Providing intelligent suggestions for potential causes and solutions
- Offering a seamless integration within your VS Code development environment

## Features

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing AI Crash Finder, ensure you have:

1. **Visual Studio Code** version 1.100.0 or later
2. **Azure OpenAI Service** access with a deployed GPT model
3. A **Git repository** in your workspace

### Install the Extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "AI Crash Finder"
4. Click "Install" on the extension

Alternatively, you can install from the command line:
```bash
code --install-extension ai-crash-finder
```

## Configuration

### Azure OpenAI Setup

Before using the extension, you need to configure your Azure OpenAI credentials:

1. **Open Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. **Run Configuration Command**: Type "AI Crash Finder: Configure Azure OpenAI" and select it
3. **Enter Required Information**:
   - **Azure OpenAI Endpoint**: Your Azure OpenAI service endpoint URL
   - **API Key**: Your Azure OpenAI API key
   - **Deployment Name**: The name of your deployed GPT model (default: gpt-4o-mini)

### Configuration Management

- **Clear Configuration**: Use "AI Crash Finder: Clear Configuration" to remove stored credentials
- **Update Settings**: Re-run the configuration command to update existing settings
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely using VS Code's secret storage system

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Open Your Project**: Ensure you're working in a VS Code workspace with a Git repository

2. **Start Analysis**: 
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Type "AI: Analyze Issue from Git Diff" and select it

3. **Select Commit Range**:
   - Choose the **starting commit** (the baseline for comparison)
   - Choose the **ending commit** (the commit to analyze changes up to)

4. **Describe the Issue**:
   - Enter a clear description of the production issue
   - Example: "The application crashes when users try to login"

5. **Review Analysis**:
   - The AI analysis will appear in a dedicated panel
   - Review the suggested files, line numbers, and potential causes
   - Use the insights to guide your debugging efforts

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide detailed issue descriptions for better AI analysis
- **Relevant Timeframe**: Choose commit ranges that align with when the issue was introduced
- **Multiple Analyses**: Run analysis on different commit ranges to narrow down the cause
- **Combine with Testing**: Use AI insights alongside your testing and debugging workflow

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Visual Studio Code**: Version 1.100.0 or later
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
